# How to use

After having downloaded the repository and using PowerShell, do:
- configure your own database and fill out .env.
- get to the repository using cd.
- type php artisan migrate.
- type php artisan db:seed --class=ArtistSeeder.
- type php artisan db:seed --class=CharacterSeeder.
- type php artisan serve.
- use the IP address that's displayed to get to the website locally.
- wear sunglasses, as this website's superpower is to blind people. (I kinda like it though, it reminds me of Robin or Wolverine).
